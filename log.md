# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, Oct 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Responsive Design with Bootstrap in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** This was my first time really messing with bootstrap. I have used it in WordPress and had not known that was what I was using. It was fun correlating the codes I saw in practice with what I had seen in WP. I was getting a bit antsy towards the end and realized that my timer was not running. I'm pretty sure I did well over an hour lol.
