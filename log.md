# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, Oct 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Responsive Design with Bootstrap in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** This was my first time really messing with bootstrap. I have used it in WordPress and had not known that was what I was using. It was fun correlating the codes I saw in practice with what I had seen in WP. I was getting a bit antsy towards the end and realized that my timer was not running. I'm pretty sure I did well over an hour lol.

### Day 2: Tuesday, Oct 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished JQuery and started on the Basic Tribute page in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I was a bit nervous to start in on jQuery. It turned out to be really fun. Defining $ as the bling symbol really helped me realize I was "blinging" out whatever selector I chose with the change, animation etc. I just started in on the first project. It's pretty easy for me to look at something and copy it or have the genral idea of what I am suppose to copy, but I have a hard time allowing my mind the freedom to create from scratch.
