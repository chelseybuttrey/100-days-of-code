# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday, Oct 23, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Responsive Design with Bootstrap in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** This was my first time really messing with bootstrap. I have used it in WordPress and had not known that was what I was using. It was fun correlating the codes I saw in practice with what I had seen in WP. I was getting a bit antsy towards the end and realized that my timer was not running. I'm pretty sure I did well over an hour lol.

### Day 2: Tuesday, Oct 24, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished JQuery and started on the Basic Tribute page in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I was a bit nervous to start in on jQuery. It turned out to be really fun. Defining $ as the bling symbol really helped me realize I was "blinging" out whatever selector I chose with the change, animation etc. I just started in on the first project. It's pretty easy for me to look at something and copy it or have the genral idea of what I am suppose to copy, but I have a hard time allowing my mind the freedom to create from scratch.

### Day 3: Saturday, Nov 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic Tribute page from FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Life suddenly got crazy after days 1&2. I realize it was only two days, but I'm not starting over. I want to see the progress I make. I need to see it, even if I skip days. I created a simple tribute page for Corrie Ten Boom today. It was fun and refreshing.

### Day 4: Sunday, Nov 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started on Portfolio project from Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to go simple with this as we have really just covered HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. But, I also want this to look half way decent when I'm done and then maybe use it on my actual site. I'm not sure I want to build something more complex than a one pager on code pen. I realize I don't have to stick with code pen, but I am for now. This also sounds dumb, but I'm having a hard time picking a color palette.

### Day 5: Monday, Nov 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started on Portfolio project from Freecodecamp

**Thoughts:** Worked on the portfolio project from Freecodecamp. Not really liking how the images are laying out. I'm sourcing all of them off flickr. I'm struggling over obsessing over this project and just getting it done so that I can move on.
